# Mangopad
Metro style text editor with most of everything you'd expect from a basic text editor.
Current features:
  * New, Open, Save As, Save, and Exit straight from the program
  * Select All, Find, Replace (In progress)
  * Quick Save
  * Print (Iffy with some printer drivers, I am not 100% sure why)
  * Auto-Save (Enabled by default, toggleable)
